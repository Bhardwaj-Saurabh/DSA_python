## 💻 How to Run the Code

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### 🗂️ Step 1: Create a New Directory
Open your terminal and create a new directory:

```bash
mkdir DSA_Python
cd DSA_Python
```

### 🔗 Step 2: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Bhardwaj-Saurabh/DSA_python.git
```

### 🐍 Step 3: Set Up a Python Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment to keep your dependencies organized:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### ▶️ Step 4: Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the environment with the following command:

- **On macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
- **On Windows**:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

### 📦 Step 5: Install Dependencies
Install all the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you are all set! 🚀 You can start exploring the code and running the scripts to practice and prepare for your interviews.
